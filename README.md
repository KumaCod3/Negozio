I'm learning Java so I decided to create a small project, I'm not sure you can still call it small at this point, but def is only for exercise and not for actually being used.
Any suggestions / comments will be welcome.
It is a program to manage a small shop, with customers and suppliers and a goods warehouse, It already has a GUI (swing).
It should all be in English in the GUI (but  variables an Classes names will remain in my language (yes, not a good idea to make it bilingual... dumb me)).

The main is in the GUI/Main class.
There is also a zip folder with the exe and evry file needed to just launch the program (it needs a MySQL local server if you already have one use your root password
      at the start of the program, if you don't have it follow the steps!).

I'm on:
