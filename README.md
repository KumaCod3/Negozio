# Negozio
I'm learning Java so I decided to create a small project, I'm not sure you can still call it small at this point, but def is only for exercise and not for actually being used.
It is still a work in progress, but even if, for now, I would not like outside help, any suggestions / comments will be welcome.
It is a program to manage a small shop, with customers and suppliers and a goods warehouse, It already has a GUI (swing and awt).
Some of it is still in my language (I'm gonna translate what I can but not variables an Classes names (yes, not a good idea to make it bilingual... dumb me)).

The main is in the GUI/Main class.
Inside the Package there is a .sql file to setup the database, you need to install and create a DB connection with MySQL.
Before compilation enter the Negozio.myDB.java class and edit with your MySQL connection name and password!

//TODO fix GUI component alignment
